This repository contains various Java programs demonstrating fundamental programming concepts and logic building exercises, organized within the `lab_work` package.

## Directory Structure

- `labwork/src/`  
  Contains all source files, including the main application entry point and individual class files for each logic exercise.

## Packages and Classes

### 1. `lab_work` Package

This is the main package where most of the logic exercises reside. Each Java file in this package implements a specific program or logic as a separate class with its own `main` method.

#### Classes

- **prime.java**  
  Prompts the user for a number and checks if it is a prime number.

- **fibonacci.java**  
  Generates and prints the Fibonacci series up to a user-specified number of terms.

- **leapyear.java**  
  Asks the user for a year and determines whether it is a leap year.

- **primelimit.java**  
  Prints all prime numbers between 1 and 100.

- **factorial.java**  
  Computes the factorial of a user-supplied number.

- **even1.java**  
  Prints all even numbers between 2 and 100.

- **reverse.java**  
  Reverses the digits of a user-supplied number and displays both the original and reversed numbers.

- **sample.java**  
  A basic program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

### 2. App.java

Located at `labwork/src/App.java`, this is a simple entry-point class that prints "Hello, World!". It is not part of the `lab_work` package.

## Notes

- All classes are designed with a single purpose and contain a `main` method for execution.
- User interaction for input is mostly handled via the `Scanner` class.
- The repository is intended for learning and demonstration of basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and input/output operations.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the `labwork/src/` directory.
2. Compile the desired Java file. For example:
   ```sh
   javac lab_work/prime.java
